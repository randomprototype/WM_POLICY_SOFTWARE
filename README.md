## On the maintenance policy model

The basis of this software is the model described in the paper **"Planning maintenance when resources are limited: a study of periodic opportunistic replacement"**, by Phil Scarf, Naif Mohammed Alotaibi, Cristiano A.V. Cavalcante, Augusto J.S. Rodrigues and Yan R. Melo. (https://doi.org/10.1093/imaman/dpae015)
